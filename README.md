## Description

Stray-Cat-Tracker comes from an idea of pulling together all those nice people who love cats and are willing to collaborate to track on a centralized online application a database of stray cats info. Eventually, volunteers might visit the reported places to carry out general duties such as feeding, cure, desexing, fostering etc.

The web app is still a beta, with random generated data but, it allows user to experience every CRUD functionality:
 * Report a new cat
 * Inspect details of a cat from the database
 * Edit/modify a cat information
 * Delete an entry
